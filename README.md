## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
  <summary>How can I iterate over an array in JavaScript?</summary>
 
You can use a `for` loop or the `forEach()` method to iterate over an array in JavaScript. The `for` loop allows you to specify the starting point, condition, and increment/decrement, while the `forEach()` method executes a provided function once for each array element.
    
    ```jsx
    // for loop
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
      console.log(numbers[i]);
    }
    
    // forEach method
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    numbers.forEach(function(number) {
      console.log(number);
    });
    ```

  <summary>How can I create an object in JavaScript?</summary>
 
You can create an object in JavaScript using the object literal notation. Object literal notation is the most common way, where you define an object using curly braces `{}` and specify its properties and values using key-value pairs.
    
    ```jsx
    // Creating an object using object literal notation
    const person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
      city: "New York"
    };
    ```

<details>
  <summary>What is the `map()` method in JavaScript?</summary>
 
The `map()` method creates a new array by calling a provided function on every element in the original array. It transforms each element based on the logic defined in the provided function and returns a new array with the transformed elements.
    
    ```jsx
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function(number) {
      return number * 2;
    });
    console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    ```

<details>
  <summary>How can I filter an array based on a specific condition?</summary>

You can use the `filter()` method to create a new array with all elements that pass a specific condition. The `filter()` method takes a callback function as an argument, which is executed for each element in the array. The elements for which the callback function returns true are included in the new array.
    
    ```jsx
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function(number) {
      return number % 2 === 0;
    });
